# Unit 1: User Interfaces and Experiences (UI/UX)

> Prerequisites: [Software Products and Services](unit-1.md)

## Objectives

In this unit, we'll discuss how people can interact with software applications. And we'll explore various user interface capabilities of Python, to provide a better understanding of what is possible later in the semester when students create their own user-facing Python applications.

We'll also use this unit to continue practicing our ability to run Python applications using the developer tools we've set up in a previous unit. And we'll begin introducing some basic components of the Python language to prepare for the next unit.
