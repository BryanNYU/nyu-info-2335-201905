# Unit 4: Datastores, and Processing CSV Data

> Prerequisites: [Python Language Overview](unit-3.md)

## Learning Objectives

In this unit, we'll illustrate the concept of program-data independence as we explore integrations between software and datastores. We'll focus on the Comma-separated Values (CSV) data format and learn how to use Python to process CSV data.

## Activities and Exercises

  + ["Parsing TXT Files" (a.k.a. "SEC Filings") Exercise](/exercises/parsing-txt/README.md)
  + ["Parsing CSV Files" (e.k.a. "Reporting Monthly Sales") Exercise](/exercises/reporting-monthly-sales/README.md)

> FYI:
>
>  + ["Parsing JSON Files" Exercise](/exercises/parsing-json/README.md) - good prep for working with APIs (in next unit)
