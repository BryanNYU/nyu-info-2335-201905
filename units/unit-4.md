# Unit 4: Datastores, and Processing CSV Data

> Prerequisites: [Python Language Overview](unit-3.md)

## Learning Objectives

In this unit, we'll illustrate the concept of program-data independence as we explore integrations between software and datastores. We'll focus on the Comma-separated Values (CSV) data format and learn how to use Python to process CSV data.

## Discussions and Notes

  + Program-Data Independence
  + Datastores, Databases, and CSV Files

## Reference Documents

  + [File Management](/notes/python/file-management.md)
  + [The `os` Module](/notes/python/modules/os.md#file-operations)
  + [The `itertools` Module](/notes/python/modules/itertools.md)
  + [Package Management w/ the `pip` Utility](/notes/pip.md)
  + Processing CSV Files:
    + [The `csv` Module](/notes/python/modules/csv.md)
    + [The `pandas` Package](/notes/python/packages/pandas.md)

> FYI: If you are interested in analytics and data science, you might find it valuable to learn how to use the data processing capabilities of the Pandas package.

> FYI: We're using a CSV file datastore here for simplicity. If you already know SQL, you might be interested to know you can use Python to connect to relational databases as well:
>
>    + [The `psycopg` Package](/notes/python/packages/psycopg.md) (for PostgreSQL databases)
>    + [The `pymysql` Package](/notes/python/packages/pymysql.md) (for MySQL databases)

# Unit 4B (Bonus Material): Data Visualization

> Prerequisites: [Datastores, and Processing CSV Data](#datastores--and-processing-csv-data)

## Learning Objectives

In this unit, we'll learn how to use Python to create business intelligence tools. We'll use third-party Python packages to visualize insights gleaned from CSV data. We'll also get more familiar with taking an active, independent learning approach.
