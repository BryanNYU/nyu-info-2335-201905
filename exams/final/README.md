# Final Exam

## Description

The final exam is designed to evaluate students' knowledge of programming concepts, software development practices, and technology management concepts.

The exam will be administered during the the first 90 minutes of a designated class period. The exam will be administered in paper format, so students should remember to bring a pen or pencil.

The exam consists primarily of free-response questions, but may also contain multiple-choice and matching questions.

Details about the contents of the final exam will be announced during a final exam preparation session. But generally, anything in the notes, slides, or projects is fair game. The following concepts and techniques are of particular importance:

  + [Datatypes](/notes/python/datatypes/README.md), with focus on:
    + [Lists](/notes/python/datatypes/lists.md) (with a focus on sorting, filtering, and mapping), and
    + [Dictionaries](/notes/python/datatypes/dictionaries.md)
  + [Control Flow](/notes/python/control-flow.md)
  + [Functions](/notes/python/functions.md)

Students may consult these exams from previous semesters in an effort to understand the kinds of questions that might be asked:
