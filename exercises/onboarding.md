# Onboarding

To prepare for the first class, please follow all of the steps below.

> NOTE: you won't be able to login to Slack until invited by the professor, but you will be able to complete the rest of the steps on your own.

## NYU Classes

Ensure you can access the [course site in NYU Classes](https://newclasses.nyu.edu/portal/site/e7aed58f-c4e8-4fbd-b8ab-40c86414d0ab/). If you encounter any issues, notify the professor.

## Syllabus

Read and comprehend [the Syllabus](/SYLLABUS.pdf) in its entirety. If you have any questions, notify the professor.

## GitHub

Unless you already have one, please take a moment to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/). We'll use this platform to manage, share, and submit different versions of our Python applications.

Afterwards, also consider signing up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), which provides some free resources.

> NOTE: Many students wish to associate their personal identities with their GitHub accounts, to show a portfolio of programming projects. However, if you're concerned about privacy, you have a few options. First, consider choosing a GitHub username which is different than your university-issued net identifier. Second, avoid uploading any personally-identifiable information to your GitHub profile. Third, sign up for the Student Developer Pack, which will allow you to submit projects via private repositories.

## GitHub Desktop

Unless you already have a Git client of choice, please install the [GitHub Desktop software](https://desktop.github.com/) and login with your GitHub account. We'll use this software to upload our Python files to the GitHub platform.

## Onboarding Survey

After creating a GitHub account, please submit this short [Onboarding Survey](https://forms.gle/aLCFvoVfQkRJmu3z5). Your responses help the professor tailor the course to suit your interests and preferences.

## Anaconda

Anaconda provides various command-line utilities for installing and managing different versions of the Python programming language and its third-party packages.

Unless it is already installed, download [Anaconda Version 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for either Mac or Windows.

> NOTE: This might take a while, so prefer to do it over a strong WiFi connection. And feel free to ignore any email capture forms which may pop up afterwards.

During the installation, you'll be asked whether or not you'd like to also install the VS Code text editor. You may do so now, or separately later using the link below.

## Text Editor

Unless you already have a programming-class text editor of choice, please install the [VS Code text editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/). We'll use this software to save and edit files of Python code.

## Slack

When invited by the professor on the first day of class, please join the [course Slack organization](https://nyu-info-2335.slack.com/).
