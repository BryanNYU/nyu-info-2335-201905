## Setup


## Instructions





## Submission Instructions

Submission of this exercise is optional, but if you'd like to take this opportunity to practice the project submission process, consult the [Contributor's Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) and follow the steps below:

  1. Push your local project repository to GitHub, so you can visit your remote project repository at a URL like `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/exec-dash`
  2. Fork the ["upstream" course repository](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201905) (or refresh your existing fork)
  3. Update the ["submissions.csv"](submissions.csv) file in your remote fork of the course repository to include an entry linking to your remote project repository URL
  4. Finally, submit a Pull Request for the changes in your remote fork of the course repository to be accepted back into the "upstream" course repository

This process may seem a little unfamiliar at the moment, but it will become more familiar with each repetition.
