# "Interface Capabilities" Exercise

> Prerequisites:
>   + ["Run the App" Exercise](/exercises/run-the-app.md)
>   + [User Interfaces and Experiences (UI/UX)](/units/unit-2.md)

## Learning Objectives

  + Continue to practice installing and running existing Python applications.
  + Gain familiarity with the ways users can interact with Python applications.

## Instructions

Below is a list of Python applications which demonstrate various user interface capabilities. For each application you're interested in, follow the instructions in its README document to install, configure, and run it. Also feel free to explore the application's directory structure and file contents as desired.

App Name | Interface Capabilities | Deployment Capabilities
--- | --- | ---
Rock Paper Scissors | Accepts user inputs through a native command-line interface. | Needs to be installed and run locally on the user's computer.
Speech Recognition Starter | Accepts user inputs through a native audio interface. | Needs to be installed and run locally on the user's computer.
GUI App Starter | Accepts user inputs through a native GUI. | Needs to be installed and run locally on the user's computer.
[Web App Starter](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/web-app-starter-flask) | Accepts user inputs through a web browser interface. | Can be installed and run locally on the user's computer, or hosted on a remote server for public consumption over the Internet.
[Notification Service](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/notification-service-py) | Sends emails, SMS messages, tweets, etc. | Can be installed and run locally on the user's computer, or on a remote server where it can be scheduled to perform at regular intervals behind the scenes on behalf of the user (i.e. nightly background job).

> FYI: some of these applications may require you to sign up for third-party services to perform the desired functionality (e.g. Sendgrid if you want to send an email, Twitter if you want to send a tweet, etc.). See the respective repository's README file for more details.

In the future, you can use some of the capabilities of these "starter" applications as a basis for your self-directed "freestyle" project.
