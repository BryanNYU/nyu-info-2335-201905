# "Interface Capabilities" Exercise

> Prerequisites:
>   + ["Run the App" Exercise](/exercises/run-the-app.md)
>   + [User Interfaces and Experiences (UI/UX)](/units/unit-2.md)

## Learning Objectives

  + Continue to practice our ability to run existing Python applications.
  + Gain familiarity with the ways users can interact with Python applications.

## Instructions

Below is a list of Python applications which demonstrate various user interface capabilities. For each application you're interested in, follow the instructions in its README document to install, configure, and run it. Also explore the application's directory structure and file contents as desired.

> FYI: some of these applications may require you to sign up for third-party services to perform the desired functionality (e.g. Sendgrid if you want to send an email, Twitter if you want to send a tweet, etc.). See the respective repository's README file for more details.

App Name | Interface Capabilities | Deployment Capabilities
--- | --- | ---
Speech Recognition Starter | Accepts user inputs through a voice interface. | Needs to be installed and run locally on the user's computer.
GUI App Starter | Accepts user inputs through a native GUI. | Needs to be installed and run locally on the user's computer.
[Web App Starter](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/web-app-starter-flask) | Accepts user inputs through a web interface in a browser. | Can be hosted locally on the user's computer or on a public-facing remote server.
[Notification Service](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/notification-service-py) | Sends emails, SMS messages, tweets, etc. | Can be run on the user's computer or on a remote server where it can be scheduled to perform behind the scenes on behalf of the user.

In the future, you can use some of the capabilities of these "starter" applications as a basis for your self-directed "freestyle" project.
