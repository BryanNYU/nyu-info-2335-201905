# The "Freestyle" Project

The Self-Directed (a.k.a. "Freestyle") Project provides students with the flexibility and support to create basic application software to suit their own business or personal interests.

> GROUP OPTION: Students have the option of working by themselves, or in groups of up to three members. For evaluation purposes, projects will be ranked against others of the same group composition (e.g. solo projects vs other solo projects, two-person teams vs other two-person teams, and three-person teams against other three-person teams). To incentivize individual effort within larger groups, each group member will be asked to submit a form describing and rating the roles and relative contributions of all other group members.

## Learning Objectives

  + Participate in the entire Systems Development Lifecycle, including system planning, analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance.
  + Find opportunities for creative expression.
  + Optional: Practice collaborating on a software project with other individuals.

## Phases

First students will brainstorm and submit a proposal outlining their project's scope, objectives, and requirements. Then students will implement the requirements by writing their own Python applications.
