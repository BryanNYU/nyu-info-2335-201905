## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, we need to install a special kind of web browser called a "web driver" which the Selenium package will be able to control.

There are options to use a Firefox-based browser, but the professor recommends you [install the Google Chrome-based "Chromedriver"](/notes/clis/chromedriver.md#installation). Identify the path to where you have installed `chromedriver`. Later we'll need to specify this location via environment variable called the `CHROMEDRIVER_PATH`.

## Installation

After installing a web driver, install the package using Pip, as necessary:

```sh
pip install selenium
```

## Usage
